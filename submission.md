# Fireflies.ai Clone - Submission Document
## Implementation Overview
I created a functional clone of Fireflies.ai's core meeting intelligence features with:

### Key Features Implemented:
- 🎙️ Meeting recording simulation
- 📝 AI transcription generation (mock)
- ✨ Automated summary & action items
- 🖥️ Intuitive tab-based interface

## Technical Approach
### Architecture:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)
- State Management: React hooks
- "Backend": Mock API service
- UI: Custom CSS with responsive design

### Notable Implementation Details:

1. Realistic API Simulation
- HTTP status codes (200/400/404)
- Artificial delays for async operations
- Proper error handling

2. Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript interfaces
- Well-defined data models
- Type-safe API calls

3. User Experience
- Optimistic UI updates
- Loading states
- Persistent data (mock DB)
- Interactive action items

## Project Structure

├── components/         # Shared UI
└── styles/             # CSS modules
```

## Limitations
- Frontend-only simulation
- No real recording/AI integration
- Basic styling (focused on functionality)

## Thought Process
I prioritized:
1. Meeting all specified requirements
2. Demonstrating clean architecture
3. Showing understanding of async flows
4. Maintaining type safety
5. Creating a usable (if basic) UI

The implementation shows how I approach building maintainable, type-safe React applications that would be ready to connect to real backend services.
